# Introduction

This small go program is used to convert a Toggl CSV export timesheet to the
Microsoft Dynamics CSV timesheet format using a custom mapping.json file to
allow specifying the project name, project task and role.

## How to run

1. Configure your project mapping file to specify which project name, project
task and role for each Toggl project used in the conversion.

Example `mapping.json` file

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "project1": {
      "project": "Dynamics Project 1",
      "projectTask": "Feature Development",
      "role": "Senior Developer"
    },
    "project2": {
      "project": "Dynamics Project 2",
      "projectTask": "Sprint Planning",
      "role": "Project Manager"
    }
  }
}
```

_Note: if during the import process you are getting "A duplicate lookup reference was found." error from a project task, you can replace the project task value with its ID (GUID format) in the mapping.json file._

2. Export a Toggl weekly timesheet, go to [Toggl Track Reports](https://track.toggl.com/reports), open the detailed report view and export it to CSV.
3. You can download from the release builds the converter for your os/architecture requirements and run it using the following arguments to specify the mapping, input and output CSV file:

```bash
converter-<os>-<arch> -m mapping.json -i toggl.csv -o dynamics.csv
```

4. Go to your Microsoft Dynamics Project Team Member timesheet page and use the "Import from CSV" button and select the dynamics.csv that was generated by this program
